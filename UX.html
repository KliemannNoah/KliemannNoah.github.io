<h2 style="text-align:center;">Roll20 UX Project</h2>

<p>During the earning of my Certificate in UX Design from UW Madison I worked on designing some improvements for the website Roll20.</p>
<p>Roll20 is a Virtual Tabletop which allows people to play games like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, and Call of Cthulhu online. These games typically involve several Players, and 1 Dungeon Master who runs the games. Something important to understand is that Roll20 doesn’t make or produce these games, it’s simply a website with features that help you run and simulate the game in the website. They don’t have control over all of the content, and modifications to the website aren’t modifications to the game itself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
So far as why I chose Roll20 for my project, it’s because it’s something I use on a near weekly basis. It has free and paid versions which offer more features, and for full transparency I do pay for the extra features via a subscription. While using it so much I picked up a good familiarity of all of the various features of the website, and my friends complain about it quite a lot on that weekly basis. This gave me a core group of users who I could test throughout the project, and who I knew would be able to use the project after completion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
The final project itself is planned to be a Google Chrome Extension, which modifies the website to give the desired features.

<p>My 2 big principles were to <strong>Focus on the Primary Loop</strong> and to not commit to a <strong>Full Website Redesign</strong>.
    <br/>
    <br/>
While the website itself isn’t a game, it helps facilitate them meaning I can borrow a lot of the concepts I came out of game design with and still apply it to Roll20. Much like how in Pac-Man the primary loop is to Eat Dots, Avoid Ghosts and Complete the Maze, I needed to Focus on the Primary loop in Roll20 which is to Roll dice and give the Dungeon Master the values. I felt focusing on the primary loop was important, because unlike a conventional website, this is an activity players will be doing dozens to hundreds of times when they log in, so the smoother the experience, the better the site would be in comparison. This meant I needed to look at the repetition of actions instead of the single time use like most sites.
    <br/>
    <br/>
In addition, my conversations with my friends and my desire to not replicate an entire website from scratch meant that I needed to not look at a full site redesign. What I had gathered from players initially and confirmed later on was that they didn’t want a brand new website, really they were looking for just an improvement to what they already had. Each new website has it’s own problems, trade offs and complexities, so instead of now making another website that has problems they would have to migrate over to, they just wanted what they had but better.
</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="pictures/persona.jpg" alt="Persona" style="width:100%" ></div>
<p>Now let’s take a look at our Persona. Here we have Savannah Smith, a 22-year-old Software Developer from Madison Wisconsin. She’s very familiar with technology, and is a free user of the site, but uses it enough to be firmly in the power-user category. She is committed to using the website despite its flaws and is open to learning new systems if it will help improve the game. She recently graduated College, and since then her friends have moved all over the country and so she can’t play Dungeons and Dragons in person with them anymore, so she needs some form of online tool to assist her to do that. She was originally introduced to the site by the Dungeon Master who ran her games for when they were over summer vacation, but now they use it full time do to the spread out nature of the players. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
Her primary motivations with the site are firstly Social. She wants to play a game with her friends, no matter how or what. Next, she wants something that’s convenient. She doesn’t want to have to use 20 different tools to get the game played, she wants a all in one system that has everything she needs inside of it. Her last main primary motivation is Usability. While she is willing to sacrifice some usability for having everything all in one location, if it’s too difficult for her to use or no one else in her group uses it then she will just choose not to use that particular feature.
    <br/>
    <br/>
Her frustrations are centered around the fact that despite being tech literate, it’s often tough to learn new features for Roll20. They often are a bit uninituvie and the documentation online for them isn’t the best. The character sheet is also frustrating for her, since she only has a single monitor on which to do things. And lastly the music integration to playthings like spooky ambience or victorious fanfare is basically nonexistent, having no integration with any of the major platforms like Youtube, Soundcloud, or Spotify.

<p>
    The main Design Problem and Primary Loop I looked at was the Problems that Existed with the character sheet. In it’s default format, the character sheet just ends up covering the map and taking up way to much space. Users either have to pop it out and open it up in a second window, or they have to close and re open it every time they want to roll the dice. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
Needless to say that’s a bit problematic for something players have to do over and over and over again throughout the course of their session, so my proposed design solution was to add a new tab into the sidebar and place the character sheet there. This allows users to have access to the map and character sheet without covering either, all on a single window.

</p>
<p>Work still continues on this project, with more testing being rolled out on a weekly basis as the design is itterated upon.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"> CryptoCounter Website</h2>

<p> During 'CS 506 - Software Engineering' I worked with a team of 5 other students to create an application from scratch to adress a niche that was not yet filled. My group decided to work on a website that would keep track of Social Media metrics for cryptocurrencies, and compare them to their market growth. <p>

<p> This including work from design documents to a final presentation, using 3 agile sprints to develop the application. It required work on handling the front end websight design and layout, heavy background API scripting and Scraping, and a solid backend infastructure to connect the two. We used Heroku to host the website, and django which had a Model-View-Template Architecture. The Site was made by the end of the semester, but was taken down shortly after the free trial expired, as no one wished to continue fleshing out the project from what it already was. </p>

<p> I worked primarily on the front end website development, using the Bootstrap Framework and HTML5/CSS3, in addition to Python and Javascript for some functionalities. </p>
