<h3 style="text-align:center;"> 1861: Life On The Battlefield </h3>

<p> 
<strong> Game Type: </strong> Board Game
<br />
<strong> Devolpment Time:</strong> September 2018 - December 2018 (4 Months)
<br />
<strong> Special Notes:</strong> 1st Board Game Developed
<br />
<strong> Github Link:</strong> <a href= "https://github.com/prent2cookies/1861-Life-On-The-Battlefield-Board-Game"> Repository owned by group member </a>
<br />
<strong> Description:</strong> This game was developed in a group of three people for a game design course. It is a strategy board game with survival and resource-collecting elements to it, and our key idea for making this game was to create a game in a war setting where fighting may not be the most optimal choice. One player is a soldier on one side, the other controls four civilians on the other side.
<br />
<strong> My Main Focus:</strong> Mechanics and Game Balance. Namely working on having the assymetrical game design work for a 2 player game, rather than a 4 or 5 person game like most asymetrical games are. Lots of time went into ensuring that the players would not actively try to kill eachother, but rather look for a way to coexist uneasily. Some game desicions were made in order to teach the players about soldier conditions

<strong> Game Type: </strong> Digital Game
<br />
<strong> Devolpment Time:</strong> January 2019 - March 2019 (3 Months)
<br />
<strong> Special Notes:</strong> 1st 2D unity Game
<br />
<strong> Github Link:</strong> <a href= "https://github.com/prent2cookies/GreedyMidas"> Repository owned by design lead </a>
<br />
<strong> Description:</strong> This game was designed and developed outside of class and is a 2 player strategy card game. Players compete to control a majority of cards on the board to win the game.
<br />
<strong> My Main Focus:</strong> Develpoment. Lots of time spend working on serializing the players such that turns could be preserved as well as keep their states updated. Lots of function splitting and work communicating between a backend and front end code. Initial Digital Prototype is complete.

<strong> Game Type: </strong> Digital Game
<br />
<strong> Devolpment Time:</strong> January 2019 - May 2019 (5 Months)
<br />
<strong> Special Notes:</strong> 2nd 2D unity Game, Children's Game
<br />
<strong> Github Link:</strong> <a href= "https://github.com/KliemannNoah/OwlQuest"> OwlQuest </a>
<br />
<strong> Description:</strong> OwlQuest is a family-friendly resource collection game about owl adventurers looking to be the greatest hero in the forest-- the more quests you complete, the stronger a hero youâ€™ll be!

OwlQuest was designed in Game Design 2 at UW Madison on a team of 4. We worked from initial physical prototyping, out to currently being in Beta on the Apple App Store. While whe have achieved a MVP, we have more work we would like to do 
<br />
<strong> My Main Focus:</strong> Back-End Develpoment. This was a project too large for any one person to tackle. Our team of 4 was split between 2 artists and 2 programmers, with both programmers splitting tasks across the project. Large amounts of time were spent handling the complex desision making process of how the code needed to work, and how to pass information between players and the board. In addition, an AI was added to the game that while not as good as a human player, is a suitable challenge for any child to overcome. I also spent a signifigant amount of time working on getting the project acceptable to the App Store, as well as getting the unique quest effects to work for the player.
